    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Beatrice</h2>
    <p>I have a passion for art and design. I love creating beautiful and functional things. I'm working on learning web development to allow me to make visually interesting and smart websites.</p>
    <p>I also love animals, I used to have two cute bunnies as my pets, my profile picture is of one of them because I'd rather show him off than myself and this isn't a serious resume.</p>
